# Projet-AS-L3
Project imported from https://services.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/projet/git/pp32015 accomplished in third year of bachelor. We were three to realize this project. We had to implement a program comparable to Doxygen (Java documentation generator), that means, using the couple Lex/Yarn, parse C sources and their integrated documentation (in Latex) to generate a complete documentation as HTML files readable from a web browser.
